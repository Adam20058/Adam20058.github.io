  Hi! My name is Adam and I'm a Software Developer and currently a first year
  student at Seneca College pursuing an Associate's degree in Computer
  Programming & Analysis. I'm passionate about exploring new technologies,
  exploring the rabbit hole of all things that involve the web, discovering new
  vulnerabilities that I leave behind when creating programs, and the thrill
  that comes with solving challenging problems.

  Outside of school I create small applications and websites for local
  businesses with the motto of "Packaging tailored solutions in the best visual
  experience".
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not working away on my computer, I enjoy working on my woodworking
  projects, wiki-surfing, playing trivia/puzzle games, blogging, and amateur
  photography.

<p>
  I created this blog is to share all of the random, the dry, and the
  interesting things I came across in my Software Dev journey.
