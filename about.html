<p>
  Hi! My name is Adam. I'm an aspiring Software Developer based in Toronto. I'm
  currently a first year student at Seneca College.
</p>

<p>
  I'm passionate about exploring new technologies, learning about
  vulnerabilities that involve the pitfalls of security, and the thrills that
  comes with solving challenging problems.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of school I create small applications and websites for local
  businesses with the motto of "Packaging tailored solutions in the best visual
  experience".
</p>

<p>
  In my free time I love playing trivia or puzzle games and the occasional game
  of "cards against humanity".
