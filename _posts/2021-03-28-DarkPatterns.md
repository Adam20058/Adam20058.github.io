## Why Is It So Hard To Delete Your Account But Easy To Buy More Stuff On The Same Website?

- Well, this all due to designs called Dark Patterns
- A term which was coined by U/X Designer <a href = "https://www.darkpatterns.org/"> Harry Brignull</a>

## What are Dark Patterns?

- Henry Brignull describes Dark Patterns as ‚ÄúTricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to‚Äù
  - A design that makes it easy to get into a situation but hard to get out of

## What Does All That Even Mean?

- Well, essentially this means design takes into consideration on how it can create a user experience by making the application amazingly easy to use to the point where it's encouraging maximum use but also strongly discouraging the user to leave

- Take for instance the simple task of unsubscribing from a site you're signed up on
- I can bet if you tried unsubscribing now you would have to wade through a messy maze of links and nonsensical information so you give up and buy a new toaster from the website
  - This is not random or unintentional sloppy design by the developers
  - Instead it's designed intentionally to discourage you from leaving

## How Come I Never Notice Them?

- Well this design is pretty subtle to the user (i.e. Us) who most likely most of us aren‚Äôt really focused when browsing the web
- It's sort of like showcases full of a little bit of everything of the whole store which are conveniently placed near cash registers and the exit of physical stores

## My Thoughts On Dark Patterns?

- It‚Äôs amazing how developers can combine tech and behavioural psychology in order to develop powerful subscription models for modern web-based applications

- It's kind of interesting that user experience involved in websites aren‚Äôt just about encouraging reuse and spending time on the site. They‚Äôre also involved in preventing you from unsubscribing or leaving.

- I guess the old customer service notion that ‚ÄúThe customer is always right‚Äù isn‚Äôt really part of the design in software or web development.
- Instead the idea is going through a transformation where the notion is now
  - ‚ÄúOur product is the party, Do you really want to leave When so many are coming inside? Maybe take a break and come back?‚Äù

## Conclusion

- With the growing trends of securing user data and the growing dislike of ads. I guess many tech businesses will pivot into focusing on making subscription model as there primary revenue stream
  - Which would mean there main business goals would involve growing and maintaining there customer subscriptions
  - So the development of design patterns that influence growth and customer retention will be essential for companies

## TL;DR

- Dark patterns are web designs made to influence how the user behave on website beneficial for the website owners
- It's kind of cool but also part of the reason why it sucks when you try to unsubscribe from a service üò≠
