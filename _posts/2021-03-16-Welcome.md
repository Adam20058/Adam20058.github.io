## "Better late than never But never late is better"

#### - (Drake, Fancy)

Yes you just read that. I just quoted Drake. I felt it was fitting to start my first blog post with this iconic line from Drizzy Drake AKA 6ixGod himself.

Let me explain…

It’s been a rough year with the pandemic going on and social distancing. I knew that I couldn't let the situation keep me down.

- So I decided to do something constructive with my time.
- I got the bright idea to accomplish things I always wish I could do

I went through that big list of “what ifs” and choose 3 things I would do with my newfound free time:

1. Start a blog
2. Teach myself how to design and create computer programs
3. Get super into cooking

## How I spent my first 4ish months?

- I downloaded and set up the dev software, environments, and tools that I would need
- I spent time learning the basics of Command line, Version control systems, Git, and Github
- I delved into the basics of C programming language
- I spent time learning about the the major components of a modern computer

  - Glossing over the units of information on a modern computer
  - Looked into the memory model for programming a modern computer,
  - Briefly skimmed the addressing system for accessing the memory of a modern computer

- I wrote my official first program in C
- From there I quickly started to create and design much more complex programs in C
- Once I got comfortable with some introductory topics I jumped into Web development
  - Learning Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- For web development
  - I learned while creating a collection of small web pages & web applications

## What I concluded after those 4 months?

- Programming is lots of fun
- CSS is evil but a necessary evil

- I would need to Enroll in College to cover some areas I feel that I missed

  - Mostly Computer Science theories and terminologies
  - Explore different careers in this field
  - Get better access to certain resources not easily available to myself

## What did I do?

- I enrolled in a college
- Took advantage of all tech resources and help available to me at the college

## The Verdict?

With my first year of school almost done. I concluded that enrolling was the right decision since:

- It helped me bridged some gaps in my knowledge that I missed when I was self-learning
- It allowed me to meet and learn with fellow CS students that had similar interests with me
- It allowed me to create an awesome group in which we ended up participating and completing Hackathon (My first Hackathon):
